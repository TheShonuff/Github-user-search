## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was my first React App without a tutorial code-along. It was a very interesting journey. I can say I fully grok props and state and how the components interact with eachother. I learned how to fully utilise css custom properties and implement a theme changer. This aspect of the challenge definetly stumped me the most. The solution ended up being pretty simple compared to some of the tutorials / solutions I came across online while researching the problem.

### Continued development

I plan on continuing my React journey and try to focus more on functional components rather then class components. I learned state using Class components so felt most comfotable implementating this solution use class components. However I notice that it does have some limitations.
